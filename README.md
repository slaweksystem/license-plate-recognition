# license-plate-recognition


## Project description
This is an academic project developed by a small group of students. The application in question is a basic automatic license/number plate recognition (ANPR) system using image processing techniques. It detects license plates in input images/frames, extracts the characters from them, and uses optical character recognition for reading the extracted characters.

## Use case

The project is meant as a module - it can be used as part of a larger system (i.e. a police system determining the speed of cars driving in a certain area).

## Dependencies

Python modules needed for compiling the project:

[opencv-contrib-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/)
